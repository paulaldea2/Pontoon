# :clubs: Pontoon

## What is does?

:clubs: Pontoon is a command-line Java application. The main attribute of this game is that the players are trying to get a hand of cards with the value 21 or less, but as close to 21 as possible if less than 21. A hand of cards with a value of more than 21 is ‘bust’ and is not valid.

## :hammer_and_wrench: How I built it?
For the backend I used Java and I built 5 classes:
- The Player class;
- The Card class;
- The Deck class;
- The Card Game class;
- The Ponton Class;

## :crossed_swords: Challenges I ran into
I knew how to work with Java but it was the first time when I implemented abstract classes so I encoountered a lot of problems/bugs that took a quite long time.

## :trophy: What I learned and Accomplishments that I am proud of
- How to work with the abstract classes.
